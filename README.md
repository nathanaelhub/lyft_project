## Lyft Market Expansion and Optimization Analysis

In this project, I collaborated with Lyft to identify and prioritize market initiatives based on local data insights, focusing on the Washington, D.C. area. Utilizing Tableau, I visualized key demographic and economic data to support strategic decisions for Lyft's service enhancements. The goal was to improve Lyft's market presence and customer satisfaction through targeted initiatives such as suburban commute solutions, airport rides enhancement, and the Lyft rental program expansion.

## Project Highlights:
Suburban Commute Optimization: Analyzed the suburban population surrounding Washington D.C., emphasizing the potential for increased rides in these growing areas. Recommended strategies included extending ride durations and focusing on first-mile/last-mile partnerships to attract suburban users.

Airport Rides Enhancement: Focused on the high volume of passengers at Washington Dulles International Airport, suggesting strategies to target passengers without personal transportation. Recommended acquiring additional 'staging' areas and marketing deals to increase Lyft's visibility and customer base at the airport.

Lyft Rental Program Expansion: Proposed expanding Lyft's rental program to cater to the specific needs of D.C.'s diverse population, enhancing convenience and accessibility for users seeking alternative transportation options.

Billboard Placement and Advertising: Utilized demographic data to guide billboard placement and advertising strategies, aiming to increase visibility among key commuter types including car owners, public transport users, and corporate employees.

Corporate Industry Targeting: Identified the Professional, Scientific, & Technical Services industry as a prime target for Lyft's services based on its significant workforce share in D.C. Recommended focusing marketing efforts on corporate industry workers, leveraging the potential for transportation allowances and partnerships.

This project provided Lyft with data-driven recommendations to enhance its service offerings and market positioning in the Washington, D.C. area, leveraging Tableau visualizations to inform and guide strategic initiatives.
